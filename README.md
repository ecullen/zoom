Zoom
========
Zoom is the "ZooKeeper Manager" project created by Spot Trading, LLC. Inspired by [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix)'s [Exhibitor](https://github.com/Netflix/exhibitor), Zoom provides a server-side agent and front-end user interface to allow for easy administration of services across a ZooKeeper instance.
